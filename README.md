check_local_interfaces
======================

Nagios/Icinga plugin for checking local networking interfaces on Linux,
BSD and Mac OS X.

This plugin can monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic and the error
rate of local interfaces. By default all but `lo` interfaces are monitored
and there are no thresholds which would trigger `WARNING` or `CRITICAL`.

Performace data is generated by default.

To change the default behaviour, the following options can be given:

`-i, --interface=STRING`
------------------------
Interface to be monitored, can be given multiple times. Defaults to ALL interfaces.

`-s, --sleep=INTEGER`
---------------------
Sleep (in seconds) between taking samples (default: 5)

`-w, --warnrxbytes=INTEGER`
---------------------------
`WARNING` if more than X bytes/s were received during sample period (default: 0)

`-c, --critrxbytes=INTEGER`
---------------------------
`CRITICAL` if more than X bytes/s were received during sample period (default: 0)

`-W, --warntxbytes=INTEGER`
---------------------------
`WARNING` if more than X bytes/s were sent during sample period (default: 0)

`-C, --crittxbytes=INTEGER`
---------------------------
`CRITICAL` if more than X bytes/s were sent during sample period (default: 0)

`-e, --warnerrs=INTEGER`
------------------------
`WARNING` if more than X errors/s were seen during sample period (default: 0)

`-E, --criterrs=INTEGER`
------------------------
`CRITICAL` if more than X errors/s were seen during sample period (default: 0)

`-u, --units=STRING`
--------------------
Output speeds in units/second (default: bytes, needs Number::Format for everything else)
